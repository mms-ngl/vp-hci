> A vast variety of human diseases and the damages causing the human body parts go along with inflammation. Many factors can cause inflammation from a simple sunburn to a potentially serious infection. Thus, inflammation detection is a key health test. A physician first inspects the inflammation on patient‚Äôs skins, makes check-ups and then prescribes the corresponding treatments. The inflammation inspection step can be automated with a program, that can help speed up the provision of medical care to patient. In this project, we propose some possible approaches to develop such automation process.
